  <h2> Analogy </h2>
 	<p1> If you wanted to make 4 dozen cookies, you would make one recipe and repeat it every time you wanted to make a recipe worth of cookies. The recipe is the function at this way. Instead of remaking the recipe each time, you call upon the already made recipe each time.</p1>
